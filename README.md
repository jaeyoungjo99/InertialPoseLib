# InertialPoseLib

InertialPoseLib is a library for estimating **IMU State**

## Features
### IMU-based EKF State Estimation using Eigen Library
  - 24-DOF EKF for IMU state estimation and bias removal
    - Pos, Vel, Gyro, Acc, IMU Bias, Gravity ...
  - Supports external pose update
  - Supports Complementary Filtering for orientation estimation
  - Supports ZUPT through vehicle stop detection (TODO)

## How To Use

Refer to the example file in the `/example` folder: `example-PoseEstimation.cpp`
